## LAB 2.1

In this lab, you will explore the key principles of accessible web design using an interactive lesson from Scrimba. Accessibility ensures that your web applications are usable by everyone, including individuals with disabilities. The principles and techniques covered in this lab will help you create inclusive web experiences.

## Objective

By the end of this lab, you will have demonstrated your ability to:

- Apply semantic HTML to improve accessibility.
- Use ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility for screen readers.
- Ensure proper color contrast and text readability.
- Design forms and interactive elements with accessibility in mind.

## Reflection

What accessibility enhancements were the most challenging to implement, and why?
    The most challenging accessibility enhancements to implement were adding correct ARIA roles and labels because it requires understanding the page structure and how assistive technologies interpret those roles.

How do ARIA attributes improve the experience for users relying on assistive technologies?
    ARIA attributes improve the experience by providing additional semantic information that screen readers and other assistive devices use to convey the page layout, interactive elements, and relationships, making navigation clearer for users with disabilities.

What tools did you use to check color contrast, and how did they help?
    Color contrast tools like the WebAIM Contrast Checker or browser extensions were used to ensure text and background colors meet accessibility standards, helping to make content readable for users with visual impairments or color blindness.
